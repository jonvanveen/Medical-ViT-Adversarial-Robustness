# Medical-ViT-Adversarial-Robustness
Ongoing captsone project for my M.S. in Machine Learning and Signal Processing at University of Wisconsin-Madison. Investigating the adversarial robustness of several vision transformer (ViT) architectures across three different medical image datasets using the AutoAttack model.
